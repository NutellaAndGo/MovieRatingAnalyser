"1	076780192X	it always amazes me how people can rate the DVD months before its release. Well done to you all", i am in your service. All i can say is i am a huge fan of this movie, it brings together everything that makes Steven Spielburg a GOD! From a beautiful and natural 'everyday guy' Drafus, to dazling special effects, charmingly mixed with a solution of classic John williams (music for Jaws, star wars etc.) If the DVD is loaded with features it will be spectacular if it isnt it will remain simply a masterpiece of cinema history. Buy it, especially if you are the one person alive yet to see it! I hope this is the start to a rush of spielburg releases. Bring on Indiana jones, schinderlers list and about 20 other classics! Any sign of the Goonies?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2	0767821599	This movie is okay", but, its not worth what they're charging so just rent  it. You'll most likely have no desire to see it again. The only good part  is the naked locker room scene with the jocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3	0782008380	If you love the Highlander 1 movie and the series (except for the very boring Raven series) then do not watch Highlander III don't get this &quot;self contained story&quot; theory of this movie.  They should've just called it something else entirely and simply made a standalone scifi movie.  Instead the suits nearly sunk the Highlander franchise by trying to ride a cult cash wave started by the first movie.Even if it was a standalone movie", it would still stink.  The crappy looking anti-gravity surfboard fight scene made me want to turn off the TV.The magic of the concept of the Immortals is lost when they become simply long-lived aliens. (wow, writing that re-reminds me of how bad this movie is).  The mystique of not quite knowing what the Immortals are is what made the first movie (and the series) so great.  Are they angels?  Mutants?  You never quite know and you don't need to know.Avoid this movie; don't give the suits the satisfaction of making another red cent on sales of this movie.  I'm glad I borrowed my friends' copy instead of paying for even rental of this tripe.  (sorry if any of you likes tripe ;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4	0767726227	This is a great classic collection", if you like these movies and do not have them on dvd this is the set to get. Probably not worth it if you already have them all on dvd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5	0780621832	This is the second of John Ford and John Wayne's cavalry trilogy (Fort Apache and Rio Grande are the other two). The yellow ribbon in the title refers to a tradition that the girls would wear a yellow ribbon to indicate that they were faithful to a lover in the cavalry. But the girl in the story manages to get three men to each believe the ribbon is for him. Neat trick", the little hussy!Anyway, John Wayne plays an officer who is one week away from retirement as the movie opens. He was actually pretty young at the time, but the makeup people did such a credible job that he really looks like he really did look when he got old -- except, as I recall," he was heavier than in this movie.The movie opens with a narrator who says ""Custer is dead."" This was the news of the day", and the Indians are teaming up, all the different tribes -- at least the young warriors -- to fight the white man, because the buffalo came back as Custer died, so they figured it was a sign from the Great Spirit. You know, when these religious fanatics take a notion . . .Anyway, the thing is a pretty typical cavalry versus Indians, with Wayne taking time out to talk to an old friend, one of the chiefs, who explains that he cannot control the young bucks because they don't listen to him anymore, since they got this sign from the Great Spirit. Nevertheless, Wayne and his soldiers (in the last hour or so of his command) stampede the Indian's horses right through their village and so make it impossible for them to make war.Frankly, I don't believe it. I love John Wayne, but this was a very boring movie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6	0310263662	I am an evangelical Christian who believes in the traditional Christian creed (Jesus is Son of God", etc...).However, I didn't rush out and see this film in theaters.  I only saw it a few days ago for the first time.  While I think that for Christians there is a fair amount here that should cause you to stop and think and ruminate about Christ's suffering, mostly I was just annoyed watching it.I felt the performances were largely contrived (I don't count Jim C, I thought he was fine," if a bit too ""traditional"" in his portrayal).  The actors were OK I guess", but I think Mel's direction was overwrought or something.  Mary and Mary and John didn't have much impact the way the film was structured.  I thought the actors portraying the Romans, with a few exceptions, were terrible.  What was up with the Judas and the constant nose rubbing?  I haven't read through the gospels in awhile, but I don't recall that being in there.Basically kind of mixed bag, really.  I'd have rather spent an extra 30 minutes at the end of the film going over the resurrection and Jesus' appearance to the disciples.  We could've lost at least a few minutes of flogging and maybe had a bit more resurrection in there...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7	0767809270	Federal law", in one of its numerous unfunded mandates, in effect orders enterprises large and small to keep ill people in their employ and thus pay for their medical bills. That's the law, so be it. It could make for an interesting courtroom drama as a top legal firm defends itself against violating this law when it dismissed an attorney who concealed his AIDS infection. But what the movie does is politicize the case by using it to denounce the US as homophobic, racist, and oligarchic, plus sentimentalize a homosexual who did not protect himself against AIDS. I see the resulting movie as a cheap exploitation of the subject, with theatrics in the courthouse and lots of schmalz elsewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8	0307142469	**SPOILER ALERT**I'll bet just about everybody has seen ""Frosty the Snowman"" at one time or another", and I can see why it's a classic. The animation may not exactly be top-notch (let's face it, Disney's animation was far much better; even in those days), but that's not really what matters. What really matters is the music, the acting, and the story behind the animation.It's the day before Christmas, and a bunch of children get together to make one big snowman. After some debating," they all agree on the name ""Frosty"". They top their wintry creation off with an old top hat discarded by the magician Professor Hinkle", who is just about the worst magician in the world. (He can't even perform a simple card trick, or get a simple rabbit to come out of his hat.) The very second the hat touches Frosty's head, the snowman instantly comes to life. When Professor Hinkle sees that there is some magic in his hat after all, he decides he wants the hat back. The children are simply delighted to be able to talk to and play with their new friend, but when the temperature starts creeping up, Frosty realizes he must go to some place where he will never melt. And what better place to not melt than the North Pole?So, the children take Frosty downtown to the railroad station, and he and one of the children (a small girl named Karen) secretly stow away on a refrigerated box car on a train heading north. Now, a refrigerated box car really is a wonderful place to travel in--but only if one is a snowman. For Karen, who is made of human flesh, it doesn't take long at all for her to start shivering and sneezing with cold. Frosty knows that Karen can't stay in the car for much longer, so he quickly gets the both of them out the second the train comes to a rest stop.But even after they're out of the car, it still does not do Karen any good, for they are now out in the middle of the wilderness, where it is bitterly cold. Frosty realizes that he must get someone to help them out--someone who can get Karen home before she freezes to death, and him to the North Pole before he melts into a puddle. Hocus Pocus (Professor Hinkle's pet rabbit, who decides to tag along with Frosty and Karen) suggests they get Santa Claus to assist them. But Santa doesn't show up until nightfall, and aside from making sure that Karen is warm enough until Santa arrives, Frosty also has to worry about Professor Hinkle, who will stop at nothing to track the travelers down and reclaim possession of his hat.After temporarily giving Professor Hinkle the slip, Frosty and Karen manage to come across a small greenhouse, where a whole bunch of poinsettas (tropical Christmas flowers) are growing. Deciding that it must be very warm and comfortable inside the greenhouse, Frosty carries Karen inside. Karen protests that Frosty will melt if he goes into the greenhouse, and Frosty assures her that he'll only stay inside for a minute. But once they're inside, Professor Hinkle, who by then has caught up with them, shuts the door behind them and locks it. Now all the fiendish magician has to do is wait for Frosty to melt.Eventually Santa Claus shows up, and Hocus Pocus persuades him to help Frosty and Karen. While searching for the two of them, Santa and Hocus Pocus come across the greenhouse--the very same greenhouse in which Frosty and Karen are trapped. Santa quickly unlocks the door, but once he gets inside, a terrible sight meets his eyes: Karen is down on her knees, crying her eyes out, and all that's left of Frosty is an old top hat and a shapeless puddle of water on the floor. Everything looks hopeless at the moment, as you can very well imagine. Santa, however, assures Karen that all is not lost. He tells her that Frosty is not gone for good; for he is made out of Christmas snow, and Christmas snow can never disappear completely. When Karen protests that Frosty was her best friend, Santa surprises her by using his special holiday magic to restore Frosty to the way he was before.Before they can actually bring Frosty back to life with the hat, Professor Hinkle puts his foot down and demands the return of his hat then and there. Santa warns Professor Hinkle to stay away from Frosty, and to never lay so much as a finger on the brim of the hat, otherwise he'll permanently delete the magician from his list and never bring the magician another Christmas gift for the rest of his life. This insinuation hits Professor Hinkle hard, and he complains bitterly that it's not fair," for even evil magicians have to make a living. Santa then tells Professor Hinkle to go home and write ""I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty"" a hundred zillion times", and then maybe (just maybe) he'll find something in his stocking the following morning. Professor Hinkle agrees, and takes off for home as fast as he can, so that he might be able to complete the assignment before the night is over. Santa then places the hat on Frosty's head, and he immediately awakens, much to Karen's delight. Later, Santa takes Karen home, and then he takes Frosty away to the North Pole. Karen hates to say goodbye to Frosty, but Santa promises that he will bring Frosty back to the city every Christmas, and so he does. And every year from then on, Frosty's return is always celebrated with a big Christmas parade.I've watched this movie almost every Christmas for as long as I can remember, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. It's really an awesome movie, one that the whole family can enjoy. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do so. It's a real holiday treat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9	0767851668	I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job", as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10	0767821556	This ridiculous premise seems much more suited for a modern B-movie than a classic. I cant believe Stewart accepted such a silly script. Lemmon is as good as can be expected and the only redeeming part is when Kim becomes human. woops! did i just give it away?! no matter", there are far better love stories to see. Lastly something must be said about her brows! I understand shes a witch but theyre so huge and distracting throughout, her beauty is completely overshadowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
